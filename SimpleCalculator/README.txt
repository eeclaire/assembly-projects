Simple calculator project

The objective of this computer assignment was to build a simple calculator in MIPS. The calculator should read an input string from the user, verify that the string is a valid mathematical expression, then compute and print the result of the expression. The calculator should handle basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as well as the use of parentheses and variables.

Features to be added: handling variables and negative numbers
